## Overview
Using machine learning methods and algorithms to predict the amount of theft using an FBI database. The database has records that date back as early as 2013 and as late as 2021. There are also about 157k instances of these thefts. This is a good amount of data to hopefully create an accurate ML learning model using some linear regression methods. 

## Resources
* Python
* Machine Learning methods
* Linear regression
* CT_2013_2021.csv

## Results
I am still working on cleaning up the data set. Cleaning up the data includes methods such as deleting null rows, removing unnecessary data, removing duplicate or repeated columns. Once this dataset has been cleaned up it will be ready for the ML algorithms.

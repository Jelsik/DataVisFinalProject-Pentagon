## Purpose

"Lock your car, or it'll be gone in sixty seconds." That's what they used to say, anyway. The fact of the matter is, regrettably,
every day an untold amount of property is lifted from its rightful owners, as this FBI database for reported theft from
2013 to 2021 enumerates.

As people are all unfortunately aware, most stolen property is never returned. Therefore, there must be something
special in the circumstances regarding the items of property that are recovered. Value? Location?
Item type?

We will soon have more of an idea.

To this end we have generated a machine learning model to attempt to quantify whether or not stolen property was recovered,
based off of the information fed to it from this dataset. If an accurate model is established, it could help aim focus towards the aspects
which contribute to a property's recovery. Thus providing a guideline for recovering stolen property in the future.

### Model

To this end we deployed the ____ module in Python to follow a path of supervised mechine learning. *more details to be filled in as we decide on a model*

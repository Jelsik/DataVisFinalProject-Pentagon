## Purpose

"Lock your car, or it'll be gone in sixty seconds." That's what they used to say, anyway. The fact of the matter is, regrettably,
every day an untold amount of property is lifted from its rightful owners, as this FBI database for reported theft from
2013 to 2021 enumerates.

As people are all the unfortunately aware, most stolen property is never returned. Therefore, there must be something
special in the circumstances regarding the items of property from this dataset that are recovered. Perhaps it is value? location?
type of item?

To this end we have generated a machine learning model to attempt and quantify whether or not stolen property was recovered,
based off of the information in this dataset. If an accurate model is established, it could help aim focus towards the aspects
which contribute to a property's recovery, and provide a guideline for recovering stolen property in the future.
